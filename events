# Events

One of the main purposes of Points of Tango is to list as many events as possible, to offer the social dancer the many options they have. 
An event can be listed under an international section (festival, marathons, vacations, encuentros, championships) or a local community section (milongas, classes, practicas, private classes, long weekend events).
The concept of event is the same and both international and local can have as much information.
What does the events module offer to the Organiser.
